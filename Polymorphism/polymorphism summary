1 .A subclass instance processes all the attributes operations of its superclass. When a superclass instance is expected, it can be substituted by a subclass instance. 
In other words, a reference to a class may hold an instance of that class or an instance of one of its subclasses - it is called substitutability.
2. If a subclass instance is assign to a superclass reference, you can invoke the methods defined in the superclass only. You cannot invoke methods defined in the subclass.
3. However, the substituted instance retains its own identity in terms of overridden methods and hiding variables. 
If the subclass overrides methods in the superclass, the subclass's version will be executed, instead of the superclass's version.
